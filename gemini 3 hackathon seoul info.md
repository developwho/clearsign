## **7. Hackathon Rules:**

To keep things fair and aligned with our goals, all teams must follow these rules:

Teams are also allowed to build on top of existing open source projects.

However, your demo must **ONLY** highlight the specific features, code, and functionality that your team built during the hackathon. Judges must be able to clearly identify what was created during the event. Failure to clearly identify your original contributions will result in **immediate disqualification (DQ).**

**New Work Only:** You may not present an existing project — whether open source or otherwise — as your own work. Failure to clearly distinguish your contributions will result in **immediate disqualification (DQ).**

**Team Size:** Teams may have up to **four** members.

**Banned Projects:** Project will be disqualified if they: violate legal, ethical, or platform policies, use code, data, or assets you do not have the rights to.
